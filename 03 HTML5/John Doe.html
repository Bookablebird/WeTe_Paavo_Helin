    <h2>Short introduction</h2>
   <p> “My name is John Doe, and I enjoy meeting new people and finding ways to help them have an uplifting experience.
    I have had a variety of customer service opportunities,
    through which I was able to have fewer returned products and increased repeat customers, when compared with co-workers.
    I am dedicated, outgoing, and a team player.
    Who could I speak with in your customer service department about your organization’s customer service needs?”</p>
